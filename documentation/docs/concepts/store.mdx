# The Store

The store is the heart of SoulState. It's a self-contained unit that holds your application's state, along with the logic to update it.

## `createStore`

You create a store using the `createStore` function. It takes a single "initializer" function as an argument and returns a `Store` instance.

### Initializer Function

The initializer function is where you define your store's initial state and the actions that modify it. It receives three arguments: `set`, `get`, and `api`.

- `set`: The function used to update the store's state.
- `get`: A function to read the current state inside actions.
- `api`: The store instance itself, useful for middleware or advanced patterns.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`import { createStore } from 'soulstate';

interface BearState {
  bears: number;
  increasePopulation: () => void;
}

export const useBearStore = createStore<BearState>((set, get) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => {
    const currentBears = get().bears;
    set({ bears: currentBears + 1 });
  },
}));
`}
</CodeBlock>

### The `set` Function

The `set` function is the only way to modify state. It merges state, meaning you only need to provide the fields you want to change.

**Updating State:**
You can pass `set` a partial state object.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`// Merges this object into the current state
set({ bears: 5 });
`}
</CodeBlock>

**Functional Updates:**
For updates that depend on the current state, pass `set` a function. This is the recommended approach to avoid race conditions.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`// The 'state' argument is guaranteed to be the latest state
set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 }));
`}
</CodeBlock>

<Admonition type="danger" title="Immutability is Key">
  <p>SoulState relies on immutability. The <code>set</code> function uses structural sharing to detect changes. Always produce a new object or value when updating state. Do not mutate state directly.</p>
  <p><strong>Don't do this:</strong> <code>state.bears++</code></p>
  <p><strong>Do this:</strong> <code>{'set(state => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 }))'}</code></p>
</Admonition>

### The `get` Function

The `get` function allows you to access the store's state from within an action or computation, without subscribing to it. This is useful for calculations that depend on the current state.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`const useAuthStore = createStore((set, get) => ({
  isLoggedIn: false,
  user: null,
  logOut: () => {
    const user = get().user;
    console.log('Logging out ' + (user?.name || 'user'));
    set({ isLoggedIn: false, user: null });
  }
}));
`}
</CodeBlock>

## Store Instance Methods

The `createStore` function returns a store object with three primary methods: `get`, `set`, and `subscribe`. While you'll typically interact with the store via the `useStore` hook in React, these methods are available for non-React usage or for integrating with other systems.

- `store.get()`: Returns the current state. **This is non-reactive.**
- `store.set()`: Updates the state. This will trigger notifications to all subscribers.
- `store.subscribe()`: Subscribes to state changes.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`import { useBearStore } from './store';

// Reading state directly (non-reactive)
const initialBears = useBearStore.get().bears;
console.log(initialBears); // 0

// Subscribing to changes
const unsubscribe = useBearStore.subscribe(
  state => state.bears,
  (bears, prevBears) => {
    console.log('Bears changed from ' + prevBears + ' to ' + bears);
  }
);

// Updating state
useBearStore.set({ bears: 10 }); // Logs: Bears changed from 0 to 10

// Clean up subscription
unsubscribe();
`}
</CodeBlock>
